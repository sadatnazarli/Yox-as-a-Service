## üìñ What is YOX?

YOX (pronounced "yokh") is the Azerbaijani word for "NO" - but in Azerbaijan, we never just say no! We have creative, culturally-rich ways to decline requests across all aspects of life.

This API delivers authentic, humorous, and culturally-inspired Azerbaijani excuses across 20+ categories. Whether you need to politely decline your friend's invitation, explain to your teacher why your homework isn't ready, or tell your boss why you can't work overtime - YOX has got you covered!

## üîç Who is it for?

- Developers looking for a fun API to integrate into their projects
- Anyone wanting to learn about Azerbaijani cultural humor
- People who need creative ways to say "No"
- Applications that need random excuse generation with a cultural twist
